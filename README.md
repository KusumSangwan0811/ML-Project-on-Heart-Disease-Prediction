### Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning

#### Introduction
The prevalence of heart diseases is rising due to evolving lifestyles, making early detection crucial. Machine learning offers a promising approach to accurately predict heart diseases, enhancing research and prevention efforts.

#### Objective
To predict the occurrence of heart disease based on health parameters. This is a binary classification problem.

#### Steps Involved

1. **Data Acquisition**   - Dataset sourced from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rashikrahmanpritom/heart-attack-analysis-prediction-dataset/data).

2. **Data Preprocessing**   - Handled missing values and standardized features.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**   - Visualized feature distributions and analyzed correlations.

4. **Model Training**   - Trained multiple models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, KNN, and XGBoost.

5. **Hyperparameter Tuning**   - Used GridSearchCV for optimal hyperparameters.

6. **Model Evaluation**   - Assessed models using accuracy, classification reports, and confusion matrices and compared model accuracies visually.

#### Conclusion
The project demonstrates how machine learning can predict heart disease, improving early detection and health outcomes.
